# Derived Non-Sensitive Dataset for "Hybrid Text Mining Models for Expanding Investigative Clues on Child Sexual Abuse in the Dark Web"

## Overview
This repository provides **derived, non-sensitive datasets** supporting the manuscript  
**“Hybrid Text Mining Models for Expanding Investigative Clues on Child Sexual Abuse in the Dark Web” (PLOS ONE submission).**

The data in this repository were generated from the original dark web text corpus used in the study,  
but **all harmful or illegal content (e.g., CSAM text or URLs) has been fully removed**.  
Only aggregated, anonymized, and semantically representative results are included to ensure compliance  
with ethical and legal standards.

## Contents
The repository contains the following non-sensitive, derived materials:


### • `keyword_rankings/`
Contains ranked keyword lists extracted from three independent models: TF-IDF, Eigenvector Centrality, and Word2Vec.

### • `frequency_distributions/`
Includes statistical term frequency results used for model validation and keyword weighting.

### • `cooccurrence_network/`
Provides anonymized network edge data representing co-occurrence relationships between non-sensitive terms.

### • `word2vec_embeddings/`
Contains trained Word2Vec vector representations derived from cleaned, non-illicit text data.

## Ethical Compliance
- All raw dark web text data originally used in this study contained CSAM-related materials.  
  These raw datasets **cannot be shared** due to legal and ethical restrictions.  
- The files provided here are **derived, filtered, and fully sanitized** to ensure that  
  **no illegal or harmful material** is present.
- This approach complies with:
  - PLOS ONE’s [Data Availability Policy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability)
  - The **Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (South Korea)**
  - International child protection and ethical research standards
